Known bugs / problems:
 - Update form doesn't have validation on either frontend or backend
 - Occasional failure to load dashboard upon login
 - Frontend reaches out to backend and Kitsu API separately, causing problem with scalability and makes state management a lot more difficult. 
 - Friend functionality is setup on backend but not on the frontend
